Note:

frontend-html,css,js
backend-php
database-mysql

Process:
1.Create "portfoliomanagement" database in xampp and import database.sql file from "portfolio management\PortfolioManagement".
2.Now keep project "portfolio management" inside "Local Dick C\xampp\htdocs".
3.You can star your local server on browser and open "portfolio management\PortfolioManagement".
4.Now you can login with username="suresh" and password="12345" or you can create your own login details by going into "create an account link".

Things done:
1.On dashboard we can see total amount and total quantity.
2.On dashboard we can see detail about all share on table.
3.If you want to buy or sell share you can go into "Buy or Sell Share" link.

Problem i faced:
1. I was not familiar connecting React App with MySql so i had use simple HTML, CSS and javascript.
2.I was not able to update profit/loss amount automatically. Because I had use one product table for both.
